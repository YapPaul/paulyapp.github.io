                Let me not to the marriage of true minds
                Admit impediments. Love is not love
                Which alters when it alteration finds,
                Or bends with the remover to remove.

                <p>
                O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
                That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
                It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
                Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
                Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
                Within his bending sickle's compass come;
                </p><br>
                
                <p>
                Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
                But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
                If this be error and upon me prov'd,
                I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.

                    It was many and many a year ago,
                    In a kingdom by the sea,
                    That a maiden there lived whom you may know
                    By the name of Annabel Lee;
                    And this maiden she lived with no other thought
                    Than to love and be loved by me.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    I was a child and she was a child,
                    In this kingdom by the sea,
                    But we loved with a love that was more than love—
                    I and my Annabel Lee—
                    With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
                    Coveted her and me.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    And this was the reason that, long ago,
                    In this kingdom by the sea,
                    A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
                    My beautiful Annabel Lee;
                    So that her highborn kinsmen came
                    And bore her away from me,
                    To shut her up in a sepulchre
                    In this kingdom by the sea.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
                    Went envying her and me—
                    Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
                    In this kingdom by the sea)
                    That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
                    Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    But our love it was stronger by far than the love
                    Of those who were older than we—
                    Of many far wiser than we—
                    And neither the angels in Heaven above
                    Nor the demons down under the sea
                    Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
                    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
                    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
                    And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
                    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
                    And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
                    Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
                    In her sepulchre there by the sea—
                    In her tomb by the sounding sea.

                    I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I
                    Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?
                    But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?
                    Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den?
                    ’Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.
                    If ever any beauty I did see,
                    Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    And now good-morrow to our waking souls,
                    Which watch not one another out of fear;
                    For love, all love of other sights controls,
                    And makes one little room an everywhere.
                    Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,
                    Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,
                    Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,
                    And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;
                    Where can we find two better hemispheres,
                    Without sharp north, without declining west?
                    Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;
                    If our two loves be one, or, thou and I
                    Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.
